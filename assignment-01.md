**1. Why is it difficult to find a bench in a shopping mall? <br>**
- they want people to move on, if there is a bench people would not leave and that would make the place crowded.
- they don't want their mall to become a teenage social place.
- malls are business,they are a business renting retail space to companies, each shop/company rents space from the mall owner to sell their products. The shops normally sign into a lease for a certain time period. This is how the mall owner makes their money. If people are always lingering in or around the mall not buying anything it can make shoppers feel unsafe and not go to that mall.

**2. In what ways does the Ukraine war affect your day-to-day life?<br>**
- i really want to be honest. because if you're asking about me, i would say that ukraine war didn't affect my day-day life but if it's for other people i would say that it affects them. for example we people cannot travel to a certain location, it depends on where they live. because of the war there will be travel restrictions.
- next, it will also affect them mentally. if they have a relative out there in ukraine and they heard a news about the war, it will make them worried.
- moreover, they will face economic impacts. the war can affect the global economy, depends on what profession and industry. The sanctions imposed on Russia and other economic impacts of the conflict could cause fluctuations in global markets, and could impact the value of certain investments or the cost of goods.

- Massive layoffs can harm students in short term. This is because the layoffs may limit job opportunities for students who are seeking internships or entry-level   positions within these companies.
- this will end up becoming a race to get a job. students might have to secure internships for entry level positions.
- massive layoffs can create opportunities for student who are interested in making new products. As companies downsize or shift their focus, there may be gaps in the market that students can fill with their own ideas and startups.
